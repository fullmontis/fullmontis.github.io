    <h1>The Game Developer Manifesto</h1>
    <h3>1. Make games you want to play</h3>
    <p>
      You are free to create whatever you want, as long as it is what
      <i>you</i> want. Do not create just to appeal to a specific
      market.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not listen to people that tell you what you should or should
      not do. Just do what you feel is right at the moment, and adjust
      later. This is the only way you can learn. By doing what others
      tell you, you will learn little both about the techniques you
      want to use and the games you want to create. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if you think a game is going to have no one else liking it
      besides you, do it for yourself. If you are true to what you
      really want, you will find other people that will enjoy it.
    </p>
    <h3>
      2. The only real value a game has is the effort you put into it
    </h3>
    <p>
      The only way you can fail in creating a game is not putting
      effort into it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Effort is a measure not of the quality of the game, but of the
      quality of your mental state when you created your game. It is
      easy to understand where a game was rushed and where it was
      worked on with care. Like a sponge, your game absorbs the mental
      state you created it in. So be sure to always put the most
      effort you can in realizing a good game, even if you are just
      starting out.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are in an era where content is constantly created, and any
      minute a player spends on your game is a blessing. Be sure
      that the time anyone spends with your game is worthwhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effort is not measured in time. You can make a game in two days
      and put lots of effort into it.
    </p>
    <h3>
      3. There is no judgement, only feedback
    </h3>
    <p>
      Read reviews, comments and critiques of your game. Learn from
      them, and understand what is an objective mistake and what is a
      matter of personal taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      But never let this feedback evaluate what your game is
      worth. See point 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never feed the trolls. Trolls are people who need to stir up
      debate only to feel they are doing something worthwhile. Do not
      encourage this behaviour. If you are victim of trolling, cut
      them out sharply. Do not give them a drop of attention. This is
      the only way you can win against them.
