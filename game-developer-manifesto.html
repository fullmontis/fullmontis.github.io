    <h1>The Game Developer Manifesto</h1>
    <h3>1. Make games you want to play</h3>
    <p>
      You are free to create whatever you want, as long as it is what
      <i>you</i> want. Do not create just to appeal to a specific
      market.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not listen to people that tell you what you should or should
      not do. Just do what you feel is right at the moment, and adjust
      later. This is the only way you can learn. By doing what others
      tell you, you will learn little both about the techniques you
      want to use and the games you want to create. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if you think a game is going to have no one else liking it
      besides you, do it for yourself. If you are true to what you
      really want, you will find other people that will enjoy it.
    </p>
    <h3>
      2. The only real value a game has is the effort you put into it
    </h3>
    <p>
      The only way you can fail in creating a game is not putting
      effort into it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Effort is a measure not of the quality of the game, but of the
      quality of your mental state when you created your game. It is
      easy to understand where a game was rushed and where it was
      worked on with care. Like a sponge, your game absorbs the mental
      state you created it in. So be sure to always put the most
      effort you can in realizing a good game, even if you are just
      starting out.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are in an era where content is constantly created, and any
      minute a player spends on your game is a blessing. Be sure
      that the time anyone spends with your game is worthwhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effort is not measured in time. You can make a game in two days
      and put lots of effort into it.
    </p>
    <h3>
      3. There is no judgement, only feedback
    </h3>
    <p>
      Read reviews, comments and critiques of your game. Learn from
      them, and understand what is an objective mistake and what is a
      matter of personal taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      But never let this feedback evaluate what your game is
      worth. See point 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never feed the trolls. Trolls are people who need to stir up
      debate only to feel they are doing something worthwhile. Do not
      encourage this behaviour. If you are victim of trolling, cut
      them out sharply. Do not give them a drop of attention. This is
      the only way you can win against them.
    </p>
    <h3>
      4. You get better by completing games
    </h3>
    <p>
      There is this trap that is easy to fall into, where people think
      they need to develop their skills <i>before</i> they have
      completed a game. This way, they think, the end result will be better.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is not true. The only way to get better at making games
      is by completing them. A half finished project is only useful to
      learn how to start games. But people only want to play games
      that are finished.
    </p>
    <h3>
      5. A game is complete when it has a start, an end and you share
      it with the world
    </h3>
    <p>
      Most developers think a game needs to be so polished you can
      mirror yourself into it before it can be called finished. But
      that is misleading. There are plenty of polished works that are
      very incomplete.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game needs to have a start that introduces the player to the
      game world, an end to get out of it, and needs to be working
      enough to be understandable and playable. This is all that is
      needed to create a game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once these are in place, you can start working on polishing
      it. But remember that once those pieces are in place, you could
      share your work at anytime. It is just you that puts fences
      around what your game should or should not have.
    </p>
    <h3>
      6. Focus on meaning first, and form second
    </h3>
    <p>
      You probably think you aren't good enough at drawing, making
      music or programming to complete a game. But, in reality, the
      only thing you need is being able to communicate what you want
      to. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst drawing of a tree and the best representation of a
      tree in the arts still represent a tree. You can be anywhere in
      the middle as far as artistic talent goes, and still be able to
      transmit what is a tree. Same goes for music, game design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be sure to know the basics to make the interpretation easier for
      the player. But do not waste more time then necessary on
      form. Be sure to get the basic start-end structure in place, and
      only then work on polishing it.
    </p>
    <h3>
      7. Get out of the way of the user as much as you can
    </h3>
    <p>
      Unless you know that you taking control away from the player is
      going to increase their experience, always let the player do
      their thing. A game is about choice, and the more you remove
      choice from the player, the less of an experience it is for him.
    </p>
    <h3>
      8. Always work by yourself as much as you can
    </h3>
    <p>
      While there are plenty of talented artists, musicians and
      writers out there willing to help you, none of them have the
      same idea of what your game should look like, or have the same
      willingness to finish it as much as you do.
    </p>
    <p>
      To create the game you want, you need to work by
      yourself. Compromise by working with someone else is possible,
      but should be done only after you found where your limits are
      and where you know you can't do it all alone. Everything else
      should be worked by yourself as much as you can.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only this way you can be sure to have a game that is united and
      solid from start to end.  
    </p>
    <h3>
      9. Use free (as in freedom) software
    </h3>
    <p>
      There is plenty of debate on professionality. People think that
      if they don't pay thousands of dollars in software they aren't
      professionals, that they are just "trying" and not actually doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But reality is that as long as the tools allow you to create a
      game from start to end, they are good enough for the job. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We live in a time where it is possible to create a game from
      scratch using only free software easily, from the operating
      system to the programming to the graphics to the music. It is
      important to take advantage of this freedom and remove any
      barriers towards creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have access to proprietary software, use it. But being
      able to use a libre alternative is important, because it
      remembers you that you are using the proprietary software out of
      possibility and not necessity.
