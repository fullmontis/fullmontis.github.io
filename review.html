    <h3>No Country for Old Men - Cormac
    McCarthy (Book)</h3>

      A very powerful book. I found it very engaging. I already had seen
      the movie, and I think it did a perfect job to recapture the
      feeling of the book.

      The book is harsh. Short, sharp phrases cutting to the point,
      story climaxes with a dry feeling. It is a book that really
      plays with what you expect of it, turning it up against
      yourself, and forcing you to consider reality in a new, and
      dark, way.

      Anton Chigurh is one of the scariest characters to ever touch
      the page. It is the closest thing to a death bringer, a soulless
      and unstoppable killing machine. And yet he feels so real, it is
      impossible to not make some parallels with real life
      psychopaths. And by doing so, we are forced into thinking about
      how dark the human soul can be.
