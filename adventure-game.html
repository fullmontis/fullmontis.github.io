    <h1>The Adventuring Game Rules</h1>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      This is a game for those who want to combine exploration of
      one's surroundings with a simple purpose to look up to. It is
      simple in the rules, but surprising challenging in the
      execution. 
    </p>
    <h3>Step One: Finding your destination</h3>
    <p>
      Start by looking out of the window. It is preferable to do this
      during daylight to spot things better. Look in the distance for
      something that may look interesting. It doesn't matter what it
      is, nor how distant it is. Just pick the thing in the distance
      that you find interesting and that you want to visit for
      whatever reason.
    </p>
    <h3>Step Two: Find a way to reach the destination</h3>
    <p>
      The next step is understanding how to reach the spot you
      found. This is divided in two sub steps: finding the spot on the
      map, and finding a route to reach it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand where the item of interest is located, there are a
      few tools available to the explorer:
      <dl>
	<dt>
	  GPS
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  This is probably the most immediate choice in the modern
	  world. Everyone owns a cellphone that is GPS capable, thus
	  making exploration a lot easier. It is definitely a viable
	  tool to use.
	</dd>
	<dt>
	  Map
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  A map is the most important tool for the explorer. It allows
	  to understand how various items in the scenery correlate
	  visually and structurally, and shows roads and pathways that
	  can be used to reach the new location. With Google maps, a
	  huge database for basically the whole world is at disposal
	  for everyone. Using a paper version is however viable and
	  can be in fact more handy for a few different reasons, like
	  taking notes. 
	</dd>
	<dt>
	  Binoculars
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  Another indispensable tool, especially considering the
	  nature of the game. It is excellent not only to pinpoint
	  exactly what we are looking at is, which may not be
	  especially easy for distant objects, and shows what is
	  around it, making an easier task for triangulation. 
	</dd>
	<dt>
	  Compass
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  No adventurer kit can be complete without a compass. This is
	  indispensable to use the information we get on the map in
	  the real world. It is also an excellent tool to pinpoint the
	  location of the spot on the map.
	</dd>
      </dl>
    </p>
    <h3>Step Three: Reach the spot</h3>
    <p>
      The natural next step is going to the spot. Be sure to find out
      where the thing is, how to reach it and how distant it is. The
      more information you can get in step two, the easier this step
      is. This doesn't mean it is trivial, as in the journey itself
      brings a lot of logistic and practical problems that are ignored
      in the planning phase. 
    </p>
    <p>
      An incomplete list of the possible problems that may arise is
      shown here. Note that this is not complete and just acts as a
      reminder of what can rise up during a journey
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Climate change
	</li>
	<li>
	  Road blocks and deviations from the planned path
	</li>
	<li>
	  Unequipped for the place the spot is (e.g. difficult terrain)
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to be quick on your feet so that you can get
      around these problems without many problems.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Step Four: Finding a new spot and starting the game anew
    </h3>
    <p>
      Once you reach that place, you need to do two things. First,
      spot where your house is relative to where you are. Second,
      start looking for another place in the distance that you can see
      from that point. Be sure to memorize it. This is your new
      destination. You can reach it right now, or just go home and
      reach it later. Once you resume the game, you just need to reach
      the new point you've spotted without going to the first
      place. However, it is useful to do so in order to understand
      better how to reach it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the place you spotted can't be reached because it is private
      property or the terrain doesn't allow you to do so, then you can
      just pick another interesting point near it.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Finishing the game
    </h3>
    <p>
      There isn't a definite moment where one has won the game. You
      can go on as far as you want, taking the last point and your
      home as a reference every time. Try to go as far as you can.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are however some common ways to make the game more
      exciting by adding a purpose to the travelling:
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Reaching as many spots as one can without losing sight of
	  one's home
	</li>
	<li>
	  Seeing how far one can get in a specific time limit (e.g. a month)
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is of course rather flexible, so one can adapt the game to
      be as demanding or as relaxed as one wishes.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Create a journey log</h3>
    <p>
      It is suggested to take a picture of each new location for
      memorization and to create a log book of your journey. This is
      especially important later in the game, when you get distant
      from home and it becomes increasing difficult to locate the new
      destination. 
    </p>
    <h3>
      Increasing Challenge: Tools and Movement
    </h3>
    <p>
      One may challenge oneself even more by not using electronic
      means, like Google Maps and GPS, limiting themselves to
      binoculars, maps and compass. Hardcore players may even go
      without using maps at all and just orienting themselves with the
      position of the sun or the stars and the scenery around them. It
      also makes for a more enjoyable and satisfying experience. 
    </p>
    <p>
      One can also limit the means by which one can move. One can
      ditch the car, or even not use any kind of transportation and
      just go on foot.
