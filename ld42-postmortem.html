    <h1>What Is On The Walls Inside (LD42) - Post Mortem</h1>
    <h3>So it is done...</h3>
<p>    
Another Ludum Dare, another weekend of sleepless nights,
another small game that surfaced in this cruel world... What a time to
be alive!
</p>
<p>So my jam game, <a
href="https://fullmontis.itch.io/what-is-on-the-walls-inside">What Is
On The Walls Inside</a>, is now released. You can play it
online right now, if you feel like it.</p>
<p>I feel like this one was one of the best Ludum Dares I had in the
longest time.  Maybe because for once I did a lot of things right, and
while I was unable to complete the game for the compo and had to
fallback to the jam, I'm happy to say that it was an interesting
experience and totally worth the time.
</p>
<p>But let's examine this in order and see where things went well and what we can
improve next time. 
</p>
<h3>Genre</h3>
<p>I am not that good as a programmer. There, I said it.</p>
<p>Maybe it is my stubbornness in using a barebones HTML5 engine that
I made myself, or maybe just the fact that I don't practice nearly
enough than I should: but I can't make games that are too complex in
scope or mechanics.</p>
<p>This means that I am naturally brought to games that are simple in
terms of interaction with the user, and visual novels are the kind of
game I gravitate towards. This is not only a matter of necessity, but
it is also I am naturally brought to. I love stories (if you didn't
get that already from my <a
href="https://twitter.com/fullmontis">twitter bio</a>), and as such I
like to express them in a medium like games. This is probably a
controversial topic, since many people wouldn't even consider visual
novels in the same field of games; but I don't like to make too many
categories in my head. To me games are interactive experiences, and
anything that fits in that scope can be considered as such.</p>
<p>Of course, this means that narrative games are my first choice when
it comes to game jams, since it is both something I'm decent at making
in that timeframe, and
something I like to make. This however has put me at a disadvantage,
since it seems that games too heavy on the narrative are quite harder
to accept than games that are more action-oriented. That is rather
obvious, just like movies are more popular than books.</p>
<p>This always made me feel a little inadequate when it comes to
making narrative games. I mean, why bother when I know that not many
people are going to enjoy it? That always made me think twice about mi
first ideas, which always involve some kind of narrative, for
something that is more interactive and workable from the point of view
of the user. This, however, always meant that I had to wrestle with
mechanics that I was not an expert into, which in turn made making the
game in question much more difficult to make. So I always ended up
scrapping what I had been working on for most of the time, because I
realized I didn't have the technical proficiency to complete it. Not
only that, but I didn't feel as motivated to complete it, because it
was not a game I was making for myself: it was mostly for some generic
other, someone who could enjoy that kind of game. And working your ass
off on something that you don't really want to see completed is real
pain, especially if there is no outside incentive other than "it is
for a game jam".</p>
<p>For once, I was able to ignore this. I just decided to make a game
I wanted to make, without trying to pander to a wider audience for
some imaginary glory (that would not come either way). That was a very
important decision, and something I needed to understand by
myself.</p>
<p><b>Lesson 1: Always choose the idea you want to make, and not what
you think others want to see.</b></p>
<h3>Time</h3>

<p>The most important thing for me was time management. This is the first time
since I started doing Ludum Dares back in <a href="https://fullmontis.itch.io/the-call">LD26</a> that I was actually able to use
the whole 48 hours without external problems and without wasting time. 
</p>
<p>The usual for the past jams was this: find an idea, start gushing
on how great and simple it is, then grab the keyboard and start
working. Then, a few hours later, realize that the idea isn't as
contained as I wanted it to be, and end up throwing it away with a
stab on the chest while I start looking for another, crumb-size idea
to make in the squeeze of time remaining. This became such a routine
for me that I came almost to expect it. I'm glad to have broken the
spell for once.
</p>
<p>Luck was also on my side because for once I had the full weekend for me,
instead of having the usual unexpected things that happen right when you least
expect them, like the dog throwing up in the kitchen. It was quite uneventful
as a weekend. Of course, one can't rely on luck that much, but it is always a
nice thing to have.
</p>
<p>I also ended up being rather economical in terms of what I was
making. Usually I end up brainstorming tons of ideas that end up in
oblivion, or create tons of art or writing that I can't really use in
the game. This is a big waste of time, and for once I was able to
instead be more focused and only make what was needed.</p>
<p>Ludum Dare's early start also made it a lot more easy on the time
management side, since I was able to brainstorm ideas for an hour before
heading to bed for a weekend of work. This seems trivial but in fact is one of
the biggest problems I had with Ludum Dare until now: three days of work
instead of two relieve a lot of stress from the nervous system, and I was much
more productive with the little time I had at hand. I'm glad to see it
is going to be considered as a base for future August jams. Horray!
</p>
<p><b>Lesson 2: Be sure to only focus on the core of your idea, and
manage your energy so that it is balanced during the whole jam.</b></p>

<h3>Clarity</h3>
<p>The main goal for this Ludum Dare was to be as out there as
possible. Realizing that most of my games were held back in some way
because I was scared of what others may think was depressing and a
moment when I decided this had to change. So this time I wanted to
take an idea, simple of course, and I would pursue it no matter how
wild it may turn out to be. It was mostly an experiment on relasing
creative brakes that held me back in the past.</p>
<p>And well, that is exactly what it came out to be. If you played the
game, you probably noticed it isn't ortodox under any aspect. I just
followed this idea, trying to put it on paper as close as I could, and
I think I ended up doing a better job than I expected. I don't know
how much it made the game enjoyable, but I think at least it made it
interesting.</p>
<p>But this raised a big clarity problem. I admit I had almost no idea
what the heck I was trying to create. Say you want to make a
platformer: it is something that has done before, 
and everyone has some practice designing such a game. Now,
consider whatever What Is On The Walls Inside: that is something that
is completely designed from scratch. I was just following
an idea without any ground under it, and trying for the whole time to
somehow make it stand up on its own in the real world. And that was a
lot of work.
</p>
<p>I had a vague
sense of what I wanted to make, but I still had to test and feel
around the game and see if it was working or not. In the end it kind
of did, and it holds itself as a whole like a nice cake, but it was a
lot of work. This is probably the main reason why I was unable to
finish the game in time for the compo. I'm not annoyed, because the
extra time of the jam was a wonderful help for making the game shine,
but I still believe I could have fitted the whole game in the compo
time frame.
</p>
<p>I cannot overstate how important it is to have clear in your mind what you want
to create: the clearer the image, the easier it is to transfer it into
something playable. This is a staple of all arts, but it is especially
important in games, because the interactive element of games can literally
break it if you don't realize beforehand that you are aiming too
high.
</p>
<p><b>Lesson 3: Have a clear vision of the end product that you want
to create. </b></p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Overall, I consider myself more than satisfied on how this jam went
along. It was very interesting to play around with ideas and
experiment, and it was a great way to learn something new.</p>
<p>For now, that is all. Thanks for reading.</p>
